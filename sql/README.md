# SQL Analysis Plan

This folder contains SQL queries used to analyze oil and gas production data for performance monitoring and reporting.

## Analysis Questions

1. How does total production change over time?
2. How is production distributed across assets or regions?
3. Which assets consistently produce the highest volumes?
4. Are there observable declines or irregular production patterns?
5. How does production performance vary by operator or location?

Queries will be added incrementally as the analysis progresses.
