# Oil & Gas Production Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes oil and gas production data to assess asset performance, production trends, and operational variability. The analysis reflects the type of monitoring and performance reporting conducted by development and production (D&P) teams as well as petroleum regulatory bodies overseeing upstream operations.

The goal is to evaluate production behavior over time rather than optimize individual wells, which would require detailed engineering and real-time operational data.

## Stakeholders
- Development & Production (D&P) teams
- Petroleum regulators
- Operations performance analysts
- Energy sector business intelligence teams

## Key Questions
- How does production volume change over time?
- How is production distributed across assets or regions?
- Which assets exhibit consistently high or low production?
- Are there observable production declines or anomalies?
- How does production performance vary by operator or location?

## Data Source
This project uses publicly available oil and gas production data containing production volumes, asset identifiers, and time-based reporting.

## Methodology
This analysis follows a production monitoring and performance assessment approach focused on understanding trends, variability, and asset-level behavior over time.

The workflow includes:

1. **Data Familiarization**  
   Review production reporting structures, asset identifiers, and reporting frequency to understand the scope and limitations of the dataset.

2. **Data Preparation**  
   Clean and standardize time-based production records and asset identifiers to enable consistent aggregation and comparison.

3. **Exploratory Production Analysis**  
   Analyze production volumes over time to identify trends, declines, and anomalies across assets or regions.

4. **Performance Comparison**  
   Compare production performance across assets, operators, or locations to identify relative differences in output.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**  
   Develop dashboards that summarize production trends and asset performance for monitoring and reporting purposes.

This methodology reflects common analytical practices used in upstream performance monitoring and regulatory reporting.

## Tools
- SQL for querying and aggregating production data
- Power BI for performance dashboards
- Python for exploratory analysis

## Status
🚧 Project in progress — analysis and visualizations will be added incrementally.
